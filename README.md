# TEXT CLASSIFICATION USING TRANSFORER WITH IMDB DATASET
## 1. Introduction
Text classification involves assigning predefined categories to text documents and is essential for tasks such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and news categorization. 

Transformers are advanced deep learning models introduced in 2017 that have transformed natural language processing with their self-attention mechanism, allowing for better contextual understanding of words. By processing tokenized text through multiple layers and using a classification head, transformers can effectively categorize text, making them invaluable for various NLP applications.

In this project, I used a basic transformer architecture to classify text into 2 labels: positive and negative
